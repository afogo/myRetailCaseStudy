# Notes

In the essence of not going too far past the 3-4 recommended hours on this. The following is the two items I didn't get to but notes on my thoughts once I would get to them.  (If requested I could update this once I return.)


 * Reviews Component
   * The order of where this component lies within the flow changes from Desktop to Mobile.  I had the App container with the CSS property `flex`.  This would allow me to use the `order` property to change it based on window width.
   * The data is a similar structure to the other `selectors` I created so I would have followed that pattern of grabbing them and using `map` to iterate over them.
   * The stars I would have preferred to be SVG's
 * Full Unit Testing
   * Though no excuse I ran into a whole host of problems trying to set up this project on Windows. Haven't developed much at all on Windows in the past so some time was sucked up on trying to get the project up and running on Windows.  With added complications when trying to run the tests.
   * After some time I was able to test App, Button and some of Carousel.  Hopefully these give you the idea of how I've approached tests in the past. (This is something that if given the time I can revisit quickly on my return.)
